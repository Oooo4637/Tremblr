The idea of this project is to remote control your tremblr from a computer based on your heartbeat.
It only works in windows at the moment.

What you need is a tremblr, BT version is not supported, only the normal version is supported

You need a hackrf, this will let your computer transmitt commands to the tremblr

You need a Polar H10 (or another model from Polar) to monitor your heartrate and connect it with bluetooth to the computer.

There is a GUI in this project that gives you the idea of the possibilities and what it can do. 


But basically the idea is to edge you until you cant take it any more.
You get good feedback if you are able to relax, you get punished if you get stressed.
